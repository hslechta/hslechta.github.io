			<h3>About Me</h3>
    			<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://www.discoverlancaster.com/">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>. My parents were both music teachers, so I grew up singing and playing instruments alongside them. By middle school, I was singing in the school chorus and playing percussion in the school band. Around the same time, my middle school gave us the option to study a foreign language. Because Lancaster is in an Amish (Pennsylvania Dutch/German) area, I chose to learn German. Once I made it into high school, I joined my high school's theater organization, marching band, jazz band, and <i>a cappella</i> choir. In my senior year, I served as the drum major of the marching band for a show based on the music of Queen, and I also became the president of the theater organization while performing as Oliver Warbucks in a production of <cite>Annie</cite>.</p>
    			<p>For my undergraduate degree, I went to <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> and took classes in a wide variety of fields including physics, computer science, math, music, history, archaeology, and linguistics. While there, I sang with the <a href="https://www.gleeclub.com/">Cornell University Glee Club</a> and played the <a href="https://chimes.cornell.edu/">Cornell Chimes</a>. I graduated from Cornell with a <abbr title="Bachelor of Arts">BA</abbr> in Linguistics, and then spent two years earning an <abbr title="Master of Arts">MA</abbr> in Linguistics from the <a href="https://uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a>. I am currently enrolled in an <abbr title="Master of Science">MS</abbr> in Software Development program from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a>.</p>
